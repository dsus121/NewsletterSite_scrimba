### Objective
Tasked to recreate the page from the screenshot with a few given parameters.

### Overview
It was easy enough to create the project in VS Code, and begin writing the 
.html and .css files from scratch. I pulled the screenshot into the working
folder, which made it significantly easier to reference. I couldn't remember
how to pull in fonts, strangely, so I spent about 30 minutes reviewing .. 
then had to decide if I wanted to use the link tag in the .html or set it 
up in the .css. This was a great exercise in going back to basics.
